## **EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WITH JENKINS | ANSIBLE | ARTIFACTORY | SONARQUBE | PHP**
===============================================================


![CI/CD Architecture](./Images/ci-cd%20architecture.PNG)



## **Project Description:**


In this project, I will be setting up a CI/CD Pipeline for a PHP based application. The overall CI/CD process looks like the architecture above.

This project is architected in two major repositories with each repository containing its own CI/CD pipeline written in a Jenkinsfile

* ansible-config-mgt REPO: this repository contains JenkinsFile which is responsible for setting up and configuring infrastructure required to carry out processes required for our application to run. It does this through the use of ansible roles. This repo is infrastructure specific
  
* PHP-todo REPO : this repository contains jenkinsfile which is focused on processes which are application build specific such as building, linting, static code analysis, push to artifact repository etc.


## **Pre-requisites**

Will be making use of AWS virtual machines for this and will require 6 servers for the project which includes: Nginx Server: This would act as the reverse proxy server to our site and tool.

**Jenkins server:** To be used to implement your CI/CD workflows or pipelines. Select a t2.medium at least, Ubuntu 20.04 and Security group should be open to port 8080

**SonarQube server:** To be used for Code quality analysis. Select a t2.medium at least, Ubuntu 20.04 and Security group should be open to port 9000

**Artifactory server:** To be used as the binary repository where the outcome of your build process is stored. Select a t2.medium at least and Security group should be open to port 8081

**Database server:** To server as the databse server for the Todo application

**Todo webserver:** To host the Todo web application.


Ansible Inventory should look like this

## **ANSIBLE ROLES FOR CI ENVIRONMENT**

Now we go ahead and Add two more roles to ansible:

1. SonarQube (Scroll down to the Sonarqube section to see instructions on how to set up and configure SonarQube manually)

Why do we need SonarQube?
SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality, it is used to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.

2. Artifactory

Artifactory is a product by JFrog that serves as a binary repository manager. The binary repository is a natural extension to the source code repository, in that the outcome of your build process is stored. It can be used for certain other automation, but we will it strictly to manage our build artifacts.
