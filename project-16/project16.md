# Automating Infrastructure Creation With IAC (Terraform)


- Create an IAM user, name it terraform (ensure that the user has only programatic access to your AWS account) and grant this user AdministratorAccess permissions.
- Copy the secret access key and access key ID. Save them in a notepad temporarily.
- Configure programmatic access from your workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys copied above and a Python SDK (boto3). You must have Python 3.6 or higher on your workstation.
